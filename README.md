# job_search

The `perl` script `job_search.pl` open in the default browser several new pages with a query in the job-offer aggregator https://it.indeed.com/

To run the code just type in a terminal

```bash
perl job_search.pl
```
Use `perl job_search.pl --help` for further information.

Two files are needed to correctly run the app
1. `locations.conf`: locations for the query
2. `keys.conf`: query fields
